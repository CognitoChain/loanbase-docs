# Introduction to Loanbase

**Loanbase is a decentralized lending protocol for under collateralized loans**   


**For liquidity providers, We offer a sustainable yield source through lending to diversified pools of traditional micro-lending institutions. Loan Delegates that manage these pools perform diligence and set terms with Institutions / Borrowers.**

**The protocol is governed by the Loanbase Token \(LBT\), which enables token holders to participate in governance, share in fee revenues, and stake insurance to Liquidity Pools.**  


**Users can access reliable yield opportunities on Loanbase by depositing capital into Liquidity Pools. These Liquidity Pools are managed by experienced investors, known as Loan Delegates.**  


**Loanbase will have a two-layer governance system. The protocol will be managed by the holders of the governance token, $LBT**

**Loan Delegates will be able to create Liquidity Pools and invite people to deposit capital, suggest investment opportunities, vote on opportunities and earn rewards. Pools will be governed by the Loan Delegates.**
