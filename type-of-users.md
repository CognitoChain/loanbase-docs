### **Liquidity Providers**

> **Those looking for steady, relatively safe yield on idle assets.**

Loanbase allows Liquidity Providers to generate yield by lending to microfinance institutions. Liquidity Pools may fund a variety of Borrowers, offering Liquidity Providers access to diversified exposure. Loanbase is designed to be a set-and-forget solution for Liquidity Providers, as Loan Delegates conduct due ****diligence on Borrowers and manage the Pools.  


### **Loan Delegates**

> **Verified delegates that create and manage liquidity pools**

Loanbase provides  decentralized asset management infrastructure enabling Loan Delegates to attract global capital and provide funding to a network of premium Institutional lenders, increasing their potential AUM while earning performance fees.

Each Liquidity Pool is managed by a single Loan Delegate. The Loan Delegate is responsible for negotiating loan terms with borrowers, performing diligence, and liquidating collateral in the event of a default. Loan Delegates review a Borrower's reputation, expertise, and performance to evaluate terms of the loan. Once the Borrower and Loan Delegate agree to the interest and collateral ratio, Loan Delegates fund the loans from their managed Pool.



### **Borrowers** 

> **Microfinance Institutions / lending institutions / Borrowers**

Institutions looking to borrow on Loanbase can request capital by creating a Loan Vault which holds collateral and receiving funding. After submitting requested loan terms, Loan Delegates will review and negotiate terms with Borrowers prior to lending from their managed Liquidity Pools. This requires a confidential assessment of Borrower reputation, management background, business strategy and financial records. Once Loan Delegates agree terms and approve funding from the Liquidity Pool, Borrowers will be able to withdraw the requested capital for a fixed term, at a fixed rate, and at a fixed collateralization level.
